# 🛡️ RetailGuard – AI-Powered Threat Detection for Online Stores

RetailGuard is a lightweight, privacy-aware AI system designed to detect suspicious or malicious behavior on e-commerce platforms in real-time. From bot-based fake checkouts to review spamming, RetailGuard empowers online stores to identify threats and protect user trust — without compromising on data privacy.

## 🚨 Problem

E-commerce platforms face frequent cybersecurity threats:

- Bot-generated checkouts
- Fake user reviews
- Session hijacking or rapid fire cart spam
- Lack of real-time visibility into anomalous behavior

Traditional rule-based systems are often rigid and require constant tuning. There is a growing need for adaptive, privacy-preserving AI solutions.

## ✅ Solution Overview

RetailGuard leverages machine learning to analyze user behavior and flag anomalies in real-time. Key features include:

- 🔍 Real-time behavior analysis using Isolation Forest
- 🤖 Detection of bots and fake users via anomaly scoring
- 🧠 Federated learning-ready architecture (privacy-by-design)
- 📡 Firebase-based alerting system for flagged sessions
- 📊 Dashboard-ready backend for monitoring & reporting

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer             | Tools & Frameworks                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Backend API       | Python, Flask                               |
| ML Model          | Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest)             |
| Data Simulation   | Pandas, NumPy                               |
| Alert System      | Firebase (Firestore)                        |
| Visualization     | Grafana (optional) / Matplotlib             |
| Deployment Ready  | Docker (optional), RESTful API              |

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Simulated user session data is passed to the backend.
2. Anomaly detection model evaluates behavior for threats.
3. High-risk sessions are logged to Firebase with risk scores.
4. (Optional) Visualization tools can show trends over time.
